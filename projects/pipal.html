                <h1>Pipal - Meet your neighbours</h1>
                <p>
                    Pipal was one of my first projects when I joined Housing Labs. <br><br>
                    
                    For typical Housing.com users, after finding a house on the app, they had no reason to keep using our app. We tried to figure out a way to retain house buyers within the Housing ecosystem and keep offering them the best experience possible.<br><br>
                    
                    
                    After exploring a lot ideas, I finally narrowed down on a simple use case, what if we had a <strong>Slack for Neighbourhoods?</strong><br><br>
                    
                    This led me to one of my initial explorations of Pipal <br><br>

                    You can definitely see the resemblance to Slack. And that was the problem with this iteration. I don't want a neighbourhood Slack to get messy like my work Slack! That's what I hate about Slack in the first place. There's an information overload problem.

                    My team and I narrowed down on a basic set of four channels that cover most topics of communication that a neighbourhood app would require, finding the perfect balance between segregation of information and clutter.

                    Each channel is represented by a color, which makes it easily recognizable. All of this in a simple swipe based interface that changes the color on swiping, indicating which channel you are currently browsing.

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>I worked on the Development of Pipal on both iOS and Android. While developing Pipal I used Swift 2. Coming from Objective-C, Swift was a beautiful language to work with and I haven't gone back since!
                
                <br><br>
                    
                One of the features that I focused heavily on was Data Persistence. And for that I ended up using <strong>Realm</strong> for Android. I used a <strong>Fetched Results Controller</strong> to auto populate the feed on iOS. After doing that on iOS I replicated a similar architecture on Android as well ensuring consitency in performance.

                <p>
                    Although a lot of work was put into this app, the project was scrapped by the upper management due to reasons I don't know.

                    I was one of the initial iOS Developers on Wynk Music<br><br>
                    
                    How do you make your own Analytics SDK? That's one of the few things I learnt while working on Wynk. Due to privacy concerns, the parent company Airtel wanted to ensure that we don't use Google Analytics or any other analytics service. So my team and I ended up building our own in house analytics SDK. Completely backed by Core Data. It cached events and sent them at periodic intervals.<br><br>

                <h2>Optimize, Optimize and Optimize</h2>
                <p>Working on an app which has millions of users is a different beast. And that's what I learnt while working on Wynk. One of the most important things I learnt was to ensure a smooth experience in the app despite several operations happening in the background. <strong>Multi Threaded Core Data</strong>,<strong>Dispatch</strong> and <strong>NSOperations</strong> are some of the things that I developed an expertise in.

                Since the app is meant for India, one of the things that I had to deal with was flaky data connections. To ensure the app was usable in low bandwidth situations, all the images were served in WEBP. Moreover I worked on several audio stream caching mechanisms so that the user's favourite songs are pre-buffered and ready to stream despite spotty data connections.

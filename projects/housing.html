                <h1>Housing - Buying Guide</h1>
                <p>
                    One of my major projects at Housing outside Housing Labs was the Buying Guide.<br><br>
                    
                    The idea behind the buying guide was to make a simple step by step reference for new home buyers<br><br>
                    
                </p>
                    
                <h2>Bite Sized Information?</h2>
                <p>At the beginning of the project, I was approached by the Product Manager who told me that they have come up with a 30 page document as the buying guide. Now that's a lot of information. Who has the time to read that in an app?
                
                <br><br>
                    
                I realized that we need to go through all this information and divide it into different stages of house buying. These stages were, Finding a House, Home Loans and Finance, Choosing a Home and Tax Implications. All of these would contain concise sub information regarding the relevant topics. This would be aided by interactive illustrations and explanations.
                    
                <br><br>
                    
                But while doing this I also wanted to give the user an easy way to navigate and a sense of accomplishment while they complete the buying guide.
                    
                <br><br>    
                    
                Here are some early ideas that I sketched out.

                <br><br>
                
                I then translated these sketches into higher fidelity mockups.

                    After my initial explorations of the UX, I shared my work with the incredibly talented <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/saptarshipr">Saptarshi Prakash</a>. Let's have a look with the final outcome after the visual cycle.

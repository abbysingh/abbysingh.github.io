                <h1>Omio - Make travel easy.</h1>
                <p>
                        I have been working at Omio since February 2018 as a Product Designer for the search and 
                        booking experience.

                        <h2>How do help travelers find the right trip?</h2>

                        <p>One of the most important things in finding the right trip for our users is how the results are 
                        displayed when they perform a search on our product. When I joined the company we were in the process
                        of user testing our search results page. At the same time there was a parallel initiative to make 
                        our website completely responsive. This meant taking the mobile design system and scaling it up to 
                        the desktop.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                </p>

                <h3>Here's what we originally had,</h3>
                <p>
                    Our users found a few issues with the search results,
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>Is that a bus or a train?</li>
                        <li>Is that a one way price or a round trip price?</li>
                        <li>How can I see the full trip?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>

                </p>
                <h2>Branding</h2>
                <p>Right before launch, I took on the task of figuring out what our app icon would look like. How do you convey the message of sharing music with friends? Initially, we loved the idea of using a 'lightning bolt' to emphasize the 'live' feature of the app. But it seemed too unoriginal in the sea of millions of apps out there. These are some of the options I came up with.
                
                <br><br>
                    
                    <img src="./img/lisn-icons.png"/>
                    
                <br><br>
                    
                And here's what the final app icon was
                    
                <br><br>
                    
                    <img src="./img/lisn-icon.png"/>
                    
                <br><br>    
                </p>
                
                <h2>Post launch improvements</h2>
                
                <p>
                    After thoroughly studying user behaviour over time, we realized that the app needs a better library as well as a separate solo listening experience. 
                    How do we become our user's primary app, rather than Spotify or Soundcloud? The answer was to bring their libraries and make their solo listening as easy as the other apps. 
                    Our users could now listen to their usual music but in Lisn instead of Spotify/Soundcloud, thus making it much easier to share it with their friends from inside the app.
                    <br><br> Here's what the new library looked like<br><br>

                    Another one of our major feature requests was queuing up multiple tracks for live listening. It was too hectic to keep on opening the phone and picking a track. This made the experience much more laid back and extended the overall listening sessions.

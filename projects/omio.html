                <p>
                        I have been working at Omio since February 2018 as a Product Designer for the search and 
                        booking experience.

                        <h2>How do help travelers find the right trip?</h2>

                        <p>One of the most important things in finding the right trip for our users is how the results are 
                        displayed when they perform a search on our product. When I joined the company we were in the process
                        of user testing our search results page. At the same time there was a parallel initiative to make 
                        our website completely responsive. This meant taking the mobile design system and scaling it up to 
                        the desktop.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                </p>

                <h3>Here's what we originally had,</h3>
                    
                    <img class = "narrow" src="./img/omio/omio-1.png"/>
                    
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Our users found a few issues with the search results,
                </p>
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>Is that a bus or a train?</li>
                        <li>Is that a one way price or a round trip price?</li>
                        <li>How can I see the full trip?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/><br/>

                    <p>Based on this feedback, I came up with the following iterations

                    <br/><br/>

                    <img src="./img/omio/omio-2.png"/>
                    
                    <br><br>

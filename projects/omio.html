                <p>
                        I have been working at Omio since February 2018 as a Product Designer for the search and 
                        booking experience.

                        <h2>How do help travelers find the right trip?</h2>

                        <p>One of the most important things in finding the right trip for our users is how the results are 
                        displayed when they perform a search on our product. When I joined the company we were in the process
                        of user testing our search results page. At the same time there was a parallel initiative to make 
                        our website completely responsive. This meant taking the mobile design system and scaling it up to 
                        the desktop.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                </p>

                <h3>Here's what we originally had,</h3>
                    
                    <img class = "narrow" src="./img/omio/omio-1.png"/>
                    
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Our users found a few issues with the search results,
                </p>
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>Is that a bus or a train?</li>
                        <li>Is that a one way price or a round trip price?</li>
                        <li>How can I see the full trip?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/><br/>

                    <p>I started exploring different options based on this feedback from our users. 
                        I tried adding a label that explains the price, I improved the tap affordance for the ‘changes’
                         button. All of this while also figuring out a responsive systematic structure for the cell.
                          Ranging from our smallest supported screen size of 320px all the way up to 1920px on desktop.

                    <br/><br/>

                    <img src="./img/omio/omio-2.png"/>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    While coming up with these iterations, I realised that while scanning long lists of information, 
                    it is a lot easier if the information is structured in columns of similar information. 
                    In a few of the above explorations, you might see the departure and arrival time in the same column, 
                    I decided to not move ahead with that as it can be very confusing. After spending more time refining 
                    my ideas, I came up with the following designs.
                    
                    <br/><br/>

                    <img src="./img/omio/omio-3.png"/>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    This design was user tested via an <a target="_blank" href="ux_prototype.storage.googleapis.com/design-mvp-v5/srp.html">HTML prototype</a> 
                    that I developed with my colleague who also had a development background. A coded prototype helped us test more realistic interactions with live data. 
                    After testing this prototype, this design was rolled out to our users. 
                    
                    <br>
                    Here's a comparison of what the product looked like before and after the redesign, 
                    and what it looks like in the new brand.

                    <br/><br/>

                    <img class="narrow" src="./img/omio/omio-beforeafter.gif"/>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    This has scaled to our new rebranded design system.

                    <br/><br/>

                    <img src="./img/omio/omio-4.png"/>
                    
                    <br><br>

                    While designing the search results, we realised we need another way to show trip information. 
                    This is to help our users understand and review the selection they have made and hence reduce 
                    errors in booking the wrong date. Another issue that we were facing was that our users were unable 
                    to understand the difference between the outbound and return selection screen. I came up with an 
                    interaction which included a very particular UI choreography which helped users process the structure 
                    of information on the page and not be overloaded. You can see the interaction below.
                    
                    <br/><br/>

                    <video autoplay="" loop="true" width="100%" preload="auto" muted="muted">

                    </video>

                    <br/><br/>

                    This interaction gave us an <strong>8%</strong> uplift in round trip bookings! Both of these design improvements 
                    together cumulatively gave us a <strong>5%</strong> increase in bookings. We were successfully able to sell trips in 
                    a better way to our users.

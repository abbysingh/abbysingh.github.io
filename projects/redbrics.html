                <h1>Redbrics</h1>
                <p>
                    I worked on Redbrics from December 2016 till February 2017. This period involved designing across iOS, Android and Web.<br><br>
                    
                    I was approached by the founder of Redbrics due to my experience working previously at Housing.com which is a very well established name in the Real Estate space.<br><br>

                <h2>Dark UI?</h2>
                <p>As I started exploring a UI for Redbrics, I came up with a few options that differentiated it from it's competitors while also maintaining a UX that feels familiar.
                
                <br><br>
                    
                Here are some of my initial explorations,

                <br><br>    
                    
                As you see above, while exploring I felt that the dark UI really makes the photos of the houses pop. Moreover, I felt that it went better with the red accent color. On further cleaning up of the interface, this is what I came up with.

                </p>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <h2>Onboarding</h2>
                
                <p>
                For the onboarding, the client briefed me that he wants the user to know about 3 basic things.<br></p>
                <ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>The best inventory</li>
                        <li>The Concierge service</li>
                        <li>Post sales service</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                After taking this into consideration, I came up with the following onboarding prototype using Principle.

                <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Designing the Web UI</h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to carry forward the same dark aesthetic of the app to the Web. But does Dark UI work on the web? I still gave it a shot. Check it out below
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <img src = "../img/redbrics-dark-landing.jpg">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Although I personally really liked how it looked, I couldn't say the same for the client. So on feedback form the client, I worked on an iteration that was the exact opposite and was much lighter. But still carried the brand's aesthetic that I had made for the app.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <img src = "../img/redbrics-light-landing.jpg">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    After doing this I felt that it's never a good idea to show a house on your real estate website that you can't sell. And the client at that moment did not have good photos of his properties on sale. I took on the task of creating a vector based aesthetic for the landing page which I personally really liked.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <img src="../img/redbrics-landing-staged.png">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    This gave Redbrics a look that separated it from it's competitors in India that used photos for their landing page instead.
                
                    <br><br>
                    
                    After this I started tackling the inner pages. The main meat of the platform was the search and the listing page. The search listing page was a 2 pane layout that showed the corresponding location of the property that you would hover on the map.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <img src = "../img/redbrics-search.png">
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The listing detail page has clear CTA's for Contacting the developer and saving the property to one's wishlist. All of this in a modular layout.
                    
                    <br><br>

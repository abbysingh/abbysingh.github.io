#### The problem
House buying is a complicated concept. There are so many unknowns when it comes to the nitty gritty of buying a house. Most of our users typically did not understand more than half the terminology being used by most real-estate vendors.

#### My approach
At the beginning of the project, I was approached by the Product Manager who told me that they have come up with a 30 page document as the buying guide. Now that's a lot of information. Who has the time to read that in an app? 

I realized that we need to go through all this information and divide it into different stages of house buying. These stages were, Finding a House, Home Loans and Finance, Choosing a Home and Tax Implications. All of these would contain concise sub information regarding the relevant topics. This would be aided by interactive illustrations and explanations. 

But while doing this I also wanted to give the user an easy way to navigate and a sense of accomplishment while they complete the buying guide. 

Here are some early ideas that I sketched out.

#### What was shipped ðŸš€
After my initial explorations of the UX, I shared my work with the incredibly talented [Saptarshi Prakash](https://twitter.com/saptarshipr) who did some amazing visual design on top of the UX. Let's have a look with the final outcome after the visual cycle.

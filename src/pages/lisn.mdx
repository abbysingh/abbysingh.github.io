I started working on Lisn in January 2016 while my cofounders Vibhas Jain, Abhinav Chhikara and Bhargav Sosale had already started working on this. We all had a mutual fondness for discovering what was the latest and greatest music online and then share it with friends.

One of the best feelings that I got was when I found good music and shared it with a friend and the fact that they liked it too! There's something really amazing about listening and discovering music with your friends. With the advent of realtime sharing apps such as Periscope and Houseparty, we thought that sharing the moment with music would be a great idea.

We started out with a basic MVP of the product which we launched in April 2016. Our idea was to just have a place to chat and a library where you can revisit tracks that were sent to you by friends.

Here's one of our early demos,

</iframe>

We got a lot of feedback from the MVP and started thinking about what a finished product would look like. Initially, we thought that the music experience could be split into three parts, **Discovery, Archiving and Re-visiting**. With that in mind, we created 3 basic tabs in the app, one for chat, one for the library and the last for a solo player in the app to revisit music you've already shared with friends. 

One of our initial interactions was to make sharing tracks you've already received with friends super easy to re share by just 1 tap:

</video>
</div>

With all of this baked in, we launched Lisn in August 2016. And lo and behold! We were [number 3 on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lisn) and that lead us to be [featured on Tech Crunch!](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/lisns-new-app-lets-you-stream-songs-for-your-friends-while-chatting/) Woohoo! 

#### Branding
Right before launch, I took on the task of figuring out what our app icon would look like. How do you convey the message of sharing music with friends? Initially, we loved the idea of using a 'lightning bolt' to emphasize the 'live' feature of the app. But it seemed too unoriginal in the sea of millions of apps out there. These are some of the options I came up with.

#### Post launch improvements

After thoroughly studying user behaviour over time, we realized that the app needs a better library as well as a separate solo listening experience. How do we become our user's primary app, rather than Spotify or Soundcloud? The answer was to bring their libraries and make their solo listening as easy as the other apps. Our users could now listen to their usual music but in Lisn instead of Spotify/Soundcloud, thus making it much easier to share it with their friends from inside the app. 

Here's what the new library looked like

#### Impact üç™
A new library and a new sharing experience lead to a **10%‚¨ÜÔ∏è** increase in songs shared!

#### Lisn was shut down in late 2017
After a roller coaster of emotions and loads of work, we took the decision to shut down Lisn. You can read more [here](https://medium.com/@abhinavchhikara/were-shutting-down-lisn-84758dfce2c4) and [here](https://www.techinasia.com/music-app-lisn-shutdown-insights-from-failed-startups)

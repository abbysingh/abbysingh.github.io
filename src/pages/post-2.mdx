Omio sells tickets for buses, trains, flights, and ferries too. Every transport mode has a different mental model with which travellers approach buying these tickets. And every vendor sells tickets differently for their respective transport mode. Omio tries to fix these problems by offering users a consistent ticket buying experience whether it be a bus, train or flight.

###### The problem

Omio works with different travel providers. Each provider has a distinct and complex fare/class system. All these fares and classes are interdependant e.g. a refundable fare may only be available in first class. This makes it extremely confusing for the user. The user‚Äôs needs are not being met. Omio‚Äôs conversion for fare upgrades was almost 50% lower than other products on the market

###### What the design looked like before

In an earlier iteration of Omio the class and fare options were hidden behind a button. This led to a few problems:

- Users didn‚Äôt know what their options were because the button was easy to miss
- Even when the user would tap the button to see all the options, they would find it confusing
- For the transport company, Omio‚Äôs class and fare upgrade conversions were much lower than the industry standard

#### Exploring possible solutions üîÆ

I came up two hypotheses:

- The user doesn't need to see all the options simultaneously as this is overwhelming
- A consistent naming system was required that could clearly categorise the classes and fares of multiple transport options into a few broad categories e.g. flexibility, comfort

Based on these assumptions, I started exploring some options that showed the class and fare options more clearly.

<p className="image-caption">An early prototype of my proposed solution</p>

In my proposed solution I decided to balance the number of choices the user has with the number of choices visible on the screen at a glance. The best solution was achieved by ensuring that the correct information was accessible at the most pertinent time.

#### Impact üç™

A few months after this had been shipped and significant data had been collected, I was happy to see that we had a ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **15%** increase in class and fare upgrades!

At Omio, we sell tickets for buses, trains, flights and recently, ferries too. Every transport mode has a different mental model with which travellers approach buying these tickets. And every vendor sells tickets differently for their respective transport mode. At Omio, we try to fix these problems by offering our users a consistent ticket buying experience whether it be a bus, train or flight.

###### The problem
Omio works with different travel providers, each provider has a very different and complex fare and class system. All these fares and classes may be inter dependant on each other. (For example, a refundable fare might only be available in 1st class). All of this makes it extremely confusing for the user. The user‚Äôs needs are not being met. Omio‚Äôs conversion for fare upgrades was *almost 50% lower* than other products on the market

###### What the design looked like before
In an earlier iteration of Omio, the class and fare options were hidden behind a button. This lead to a few problems,
- For the user, they didn‚Äôt know what their options were, as the button was easy to miss.
- Even when the user would tap the button to see all the options, they would be confusing
- For the transport company, our class and fare upgrade conversions were much lower than the industry standard.

#### Exploring possible solutions üîÆ
I came up with a few hypotheses,
- The user doesn't need to see all the options at the same time
- We need a consistent naming system that clearly categorises the classes and fares of multiple transport options into a few broad categories such as flexibility and comfort

Based on these assumptions, I started exploring some options that showed the class and fare options more up front.

<p className="image-caption">An early prototype of my proposed solution</p>

In my proposed solution, I decided to balance the number of choices the user has versus the number of choices visible on the screen at a glance. By using clear principles of the right amount of information being there for you right when you need it.

#### Impact üç™
A few months after this had been shipped and significant data had been collected, I was happy to see that we had a **15%‚¨ÜÔ∏è** increase in class and fare upgrades!

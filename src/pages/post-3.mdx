One of the most important things in finding the right trip for our users is how the results are displayed when they perform a search on our product. When I joined the company we were in the process of user testing our search results page. At the same time there was a parallel initiative to make our website completely responsive. This meant taking the mobile design system and scaling it up to the desktop. 

###### The problem
At Omio, our users were having trouble searching because a) Our search results had legibility issues, and b) Our return trip experience was really confusing because the search results for outbound and return journeys looked too similar

###### What the design looked like before I started
The design I started working with had the following problems, 
- There was no way to tell if the price was for one-way or for round trip
- The number of changes in a trip were unclear
- Our users said that the information on the screen was too dense and hard to read.

<div className = "blog-content-image-container">
<img src={props.images[0].publicURL} className="blog-content-image" />
</div>

I started exploring different options based on this feedback from our users. I tried adding a label that explains the price, I improved the tap affordance for the ‘changes’ button. All of this while also figuring out a responsive systematic structure for the cell. Ranging from our smallest supported screen size of 320px all the way up to 1920px on desktop.

</div>
